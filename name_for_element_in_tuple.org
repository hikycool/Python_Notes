* Introduction

  Sometimes we use tuple instead of list because of less memory.
  And it is hard to maintain when use index in tuple, like S[0],
  What's more, not beatiful like that.
  So do it should do something to name for element in tuple

* Named like macro definition
  
  For simple, index of number can be redefine in beginning of code file.
  It is simaliar to Macro definition in C/C++.

** Example:
   
   NAME = 0
   AGE = 1
   SEX = 2
   
   or
   AGE, SEX = xrange(2)   #enum

* Use namedtuple instead of tuple

  namedtuple is from collections, so before use it. It should be invoke in
  in beginning of file.
  
** Example:
   
   from collections import namedtuple
   
   # it like to create a new struction in python program
   Student = namedtule('student', ['name', 'age'])
   s = Student('Jim', '16')                 # it is simaliar to contructor
   
   # we can use 'name' or 'age' to use elemnt.
   s.name
   s.age
