* Statics in List

** Make it dictionary
   
   new = dict.fromkeys(list, 0)
   if key in list :
      new[key] += 1
   else:
      new[key] = 1

** Using Counter in collections

   The counter is a constructor.
   c = Counter(list)
   print c.most_common(3) # print most three frequency in list

* Statics in a English letter list

  Search all letter in a file and then count the frequency of all
  letter in this file.

** Using re and Counter
   
   Using regular expression to splite all letter in every word.
   re.splite('\w+', txt)
   Then the Counter can do it.
